                <h3>Biography</h3>
                <p>I grew up in the Snoqulamie Valley. A more rural area east of Seattle about thirty mins. I finished high school and went to school in Bellingham, WA. After several years I moved to Montana to try to experience "cold smoke". I light an fluffy skiing condition I was not able to experience. The following year, I was in a service-term that took me all over the eastern United States. After returning I moved to just south of Seattle.</p>
